# OFF - OWASP Findings Format

The OWASP Findings Format is a standardized structure for security items.

# Why?

The idea behind OFF is to provide a unified *open independent and trusted* format that tools can export.

As this standard format is adopted and used, it will facilitate: 
1. Standardized representation of security findings in dashboards and such
2. Standardized format for mining data out of large sets of findings from different tools

# How to Use It

The OFF project initially defineds a JSON Schema for findings.  Simply produce JSON that meets the validation requirements defined in the schema and offer this as an export option.
