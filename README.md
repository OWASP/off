# OFF - OWASP Findings Format

The OWASP Findings Format is a standardized structure for security items.

# Why?

The idea behind OFF is to provide a unified *open independent and trusted* format that tools can export.

As this standard format is adopted and used, it will facilitate: 
1. Standardized representation of security findings in dashboards and such
2. Standardized format for mining data out of large sets of findings from different tools

# How to Use It

The OFF project initially defineds a JSON Schema for findings.  Simply produce JSON that meets the validation requirements defined in the schema and offer this as an export option.

# Setup for Testing

`npm install ajv
`node simpletest.js

## Command Line

We can use AJV to validate from the command line.
`npm install ajv-cli
`ajv validate -s owasp.off.schema.json -d example.finding.json

# Credits

The idea for OFF came from a Dallas OWASP Meeting where a participant indicated that the Indianapolis OWASP
Chapter had conceived of this idea and many exhortations to advance this as a standard.
